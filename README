School project for the MODS206: Data analysis in economics 2: Applied Econometrics course at Télécom Paris.
The goal of the project was to determine the influence of the Student-Teacher ratio in primary school and the public expenditure on labour market programs on the share of young people not in education, employment or training (NEET rate) in OECD countries.
For that, we collected data on the OECD website for different years and many different countries in the OECD, and we ran OLS regressions on our data, including control variables to strengthen our model.
In addition, as we have worked with panel data, we checked the presence of time and entity fixed effects, as well as non linear interactions between some of the variables.
